<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>UGA DOOGA LLC</strong> (“<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”), an Armenia-based company, collects, uses, and shares personal information when you use our calorie and macronutrient tracking bot service (“<strong>Service</strong>”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal data transparently. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.</p>

<h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect a broad range of personal and usage data to provide and improve the Service, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect identifiers such as your name, email address, and login credentials:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. We may also ask for basic profile details like age, gender, or other demographic information you choose to provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Health and Nutritional Data:</strong> To help track your diet and wellness, we collect information you provide about your dietary goals, nutritional preferences (e.g. dietary restrictions or meal plans), food logs, weight, body measurements, exercise and activity logs, and other health-related inputs:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. This may include sensitive health data which we process only with your consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect certain information about how you use the Service. This includes log data (such as IP address, timestamps, and features used), device and technical data (such as device type, operating system, browser type, and app version), and analytics data on your interactions with the Service:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to gather usage information (see “Cookies and Tracking” below).</li>
    <li><strong>Payment and Subscription Data:</strong> If you purchase a subscription or other paid features, our third-party payment processors will collect your payment details (such as credit card information) to process the transaction. We do not store full financial information on our servers:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. We may receive records of your purchases or subscription status (e.g., that payment was successful, the type of plan, and its duration) for account management.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact support or communicate with us (for example, via email or within the app), we collect the information you provide in those interactions. We may also collect your email address and phone number if you provide them, for purposes of sending notifications or responding to inquiries.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> Our Service is intended for adults. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal data from anyone under 18 years of age. If you are under 18, please do not use the Service or provide any personal information. If we learn that we have collected information from a minor under 18, we will delete it.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
<p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Providing and Personalizing the Service:</strong> We process your data to operate the core functionality of the calorie tracking bot and to personalize your experience. For example, we use your nutritional and activity data to generate insights, track your progress, and provide tailored recommendations or feedback on your diet and exercise. We also use your information to maintain and display your account and logged entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Improvement and Analytics:</strong> We analyze usage data and feedback to understand how our Service is used and to improve its performance and features:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. This helps us debug issues, develop new features, and enhance the user experience. We may use aggregated, anonymized data to analyze trends and statistics, which does not identify individuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> We use your contact information (e.g. email) to send you service-related announcements and respond to your inquiries:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. With your permission, we may also send newsletters or promotional communications about new features or offers. You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link or adjusting your account settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments and Subscription Management:</strong> We use data about your subscriptions and purchases to manage billing (through our payment processors) and to enable premium features. For instance, we keep track of your subscription status to grant access to subscriber-only content, and we may send reminders about expiring subscriptions or payment issues. All payment processing is handled by third parties, so we generally only maintain records necessary for customer support, accounting, and compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> We may process personal data (like account and log-in information or device identifiers) to monitor, investigate, and prevent any fraudulent, unauthorized, or malicious activity on the Service. This is to protect the security and integrity of our platform and our users.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may use your data as required to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to respond to valid legal requests (such as court orders). We also may use and disclose information to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Share Your Data</h2>
<p>We do not sell your personal information. However, we may share certain data with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers and Partners:</strong> We share information with trusted third-party companies that perform services on our behalf to support the Service. This includes, for example, cloud hosting providers (who store our databases and content), analytics providers (who help us understand how users use the app), customer support tools, marketing and email service providers, and other IT or security vendors:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. These service providers are contractually bound to handle your data securely and only according to our instructions.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> As noted, any payment transactions for subscriptions or purchases are handled through third-party payment processors (for example, app store payment systems or payment gateways). These third parties process your payment information **securely** and inform us of the outcome. Your financial information (like credit card numbers) is not received or stored by us, but the payment processors may share limited information back to us (such as a transaction ID or subscription status) to allow us to record and manage your subscriptions:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Integrations:</strong> If our Service integrates with third-party applications or devices (for instance, syncing with a fitness tracker or health app) and you choose to connect such integrations, we will exchange data with those third parties at your direction. For example, if you link a wearable device to import your step count or calories burned, we will send or receive data with that device’s platform as needed. Such third-party services will handle your data under their own privacy policies, which we recommend you review:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. We only share data with these parties with your consent and to fulfill the integration you have requested.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements and Protection:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., law enforcement or regulators). We may also disclose information if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, to protect and defend our rights or property, to prevent fraud, or to protect the safety of our users or the public.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a corporate transaction such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, user information (which could include your personal data) may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction. If such an event occurs, we will ensure that your data remains protected and subject to this Privacy Policy (unless you are notified otherwise and consent to any new terms).</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregated or De-identified Data:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or anonymized (so that it does not identify you personally) with partners or the public for research, marketing, analytics, or other purposes. For example, we might publish reports or insights about nutrition and fitness trends that use aggregated data from many users, but these reports will not contain any personal information:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. Such data is not linked back to individual users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons or mobile identifiers) to recognize you and your device when you use the Service. Cookies are small text files placed on your device that help us in several ways, including to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and analyze how the Service is used:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. For example, cookies allow us to remember your chosen settings and to personalize content. They also help us understand which features are popular and which might need improvement by collecting usage data.</p>
<p>We may partner with analytics and advertising providers that use cookies and other tracking tools to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or apps. This information is used to analyze and improve our Service and, in some cases, to deliver personalized advertisements for our Service on other platforms. For instance, we might use Google Analytics or similar tools to learn about user behavior on our app or website.</p>
<p>You have control over cookies. Most web browsers allow you to refuse or delete cookies through settings. However, please note that if you disable cookies, some parts of our Service may not function properly, such as login or certain preference settings:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. Our Service currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals, and will treat such signals in the same way as other user settings.</p>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored on secured servers and databases operated by our Company and/or our cloud service providers. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption of data in transit, access controls to personal data, and regular review of our information collection and storage practices. For example, we use HTTPS encryption to secure data transmitted between our app or website and our servers. We also restrict access to personal data only to authorized personnel and contractors who need to know that information to operate, develop, or improve the Service.</p>
<p>While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, we **cannot guarantee absolute security** of your data:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. You share and transmit information at your own risk, and it is important that you also take steps to secure your account (such as using a strong, unique password and protecting your account login credentials).</p>
<p>If we become aware of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the appropriate authorities as required by law.</p>

<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>UGA DOOGA LLC is based in Armenia, but we may process and store data in other countries as needed for operational reasons (for example, if we use cloud servers located in other jurisdictions). This means your personal data may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside of your state, province, or country, including in jurisdictions that may have different data protection laws than your home jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or other regions with data transfer restrictions, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place for transferring your personal data internationally. These safeguards may include using standard contractual data protection clauses approved by relevant regulatory authorities, or relying on other lawful transfer mechanisms. We endeavor to uphold the principles of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for all users, regardless of their location:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}, and will take steps to protect your privacy in line with internationally accepted standards.</p>
<p>By using our Service, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to facilities located in other countries (including Armenia and the United States) and consent to such processing and storage. We will handle your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.</p>

<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>You have certain rights regarding your personal data. We are committed to providing you with access and control over your information, in accordance with applicable privacy laws (such as GDPR). These rights include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Access and Portability:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. We will provide this information in a structured, commonly used electronic format. For EU users, this is also known as the right to data portability:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You have the right to correct or update any inaccurate or incomplete personal information in your account:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. You can review and edit much of your basic information by logging into your account settings. If you need assistance with correcting data, please contact us.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your personal data:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. You may delete certain information via your account, or you can request that we delete your account entirely. Upon such request, we will erase or anonymize your personal data (unless we are required to retain it for legal reasons). Please note that after deletion, some information (like posts on a community forum, if applicable, or aggregated data) may remain in our backups or archives but will be disassociated from personal identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> If we rely on your consent to process any of your data (for example, for receiving marketing emails or processing health data), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, and it may mean some features of the Service can no longer function for you.</li>
    <li><strong>Objection and Restriction:</strong> You have the right to object to certain processing activities or to request that we limit processing of your data. For example, you can request to opt out of marketing communications (which you can also do by using the unsubscribe link in emails or adjusting settings):contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. You can also object to any profiling or automated decision-making that significantly affects you; however, our Service does not typically make decisions about users with legal or similarly significant effects without human involvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. If you exercise your rights, we will continue to provide you with our Service at the same quality and terms as other users, to the extent possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise your rights, you may use the tools provided within the Service (for example, editing or deleting profile information in your account settings), or contact us using the contact information provided below. For security, we may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (such as access or deletion requests). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>If you are an EU/EEA user or otherwise protected by GDPR, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority if you believe that we have infringed your privacy rights. We encourage you to contact us first so we can address your concerns directly.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of the policy. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as by email notification or a notice within the app) that our Privacy Policy has changed:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the Service after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
