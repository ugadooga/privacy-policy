<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p>These Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of the calorie and macronutrient tracking bot service (the “<strong>Service</strong>”) operated by <strong>UGA DOOGA LLC</strong> (“<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. If you do not agree with these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not use the Service.</p>

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older and legally capable of entering into this agreement:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. Use of the Service is void where prohibited by law:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization or another person, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and “you” as used herein includes both you and that entity.</p>

<h2>2. Account Registration and Security</h2>
<p><strong>Account Creation:</strong> To access certain features of the Service, you may need to create an account. When registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself and to keep this information updated:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. You must not impersonate anyone or provide false details. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter is or becomes inaccurate, false, or misleading:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}.</p>
<p><strong>Account Responsibilities:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}. You should use a strong, unique password and protect it. **Do not share** your username or password with others. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you must promptly notify us. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to safeguard your account information or for unauthorized access to your account (to the extent not caused by us):contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}.</p>
<p><strong>One Account Per User:</strong> You may only create one account for your personal use of the Service, unless explicitly permitted by us (for example, separate professional or enterprise accounts). You may not sell, lease, or transfer your account to any other person.</p>

<h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
<p>The Service is a software application (including any associated mobile or web apps, bots, or platforms) designed to help you track your calorie intake, macronutrient consumption, and related health and nutrition information. It allows you to log foods and exercises, set goals, obtain nutritional information, and view analytical data about your diet and activity. The Service may offer personalized insights or recommendations based on the information you provide, but these are for informational purposes only and are not medical or nutritional advice (see Section 8 on Disclaimers). We continuously work to improve the Service and may add, modify, or remove features at our discretion.</p>

<h2>4. Subscription Plans and Payments</h2>
<p><strong>Paid Subscriptions:</strong> Some features of the Service are provided free of charge, while premium features require a paid subscription. Subscription options (e.g., monthly or annual plans) will be described in the Service. By signing up for a paid subscription, you agree to pay the applicable fees and charges. **Subscriptions will automatically renew** at the end of each subscription period (e.g., monthly or yearly) and you will be charged in advance for each renewal period, unless you cancel before the next billing date:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}. We will bill the subscription fee to the payment method you provide, and by subscribing you authorize us (or our payment processor) to charge your payment method on a recurring basis:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}. You may cancel auto-renewal at any time by following the instructions in your account settings or through the app store platform, as applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Day-Based Extensions:</strong> In addition to recurring subscriptions, we may offer the option to extend your access to premium features on a short-term basis (for example, purchasing one-day access or multi-day passes). These day-based extensions allow you to use the premium Service for a specified number of days without a long-term commitment. Such extensions are subject to these Terms and any additional terms presented at the time of purchase. They will expire automatically after the stated period and generally will not auto-renew (unless explicitly stated).</p>
<p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All payments are handled through third-party payment processors or app store providers (such as Apple App Store or Google Play, or payment gateway services). This means that when you provide payment information, it is submitted directly to those third parties, and their terms and privacy policies govern that transaction. We do not store your full credit card number or bank account details on our servers:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}. We may receive basic information from the payment processors (like a confirmation of payment, subscription start and end dates, and the last four digits of your card for reference) to record your purchase and manage your subscription status.</p>
<p><strong>Fees and Changes:</strong> The pricing of subscriptions and other paid features will be as specified at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to change our fees or introduce new charges for the Service in the future. If the price of your subscription changes, we will give you advance notice (e.g., by email or through the Service) and the new rate will apply from your next billing cycle:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}. If you do not agree to a price change, you may cancel your subscription before the new price takes effect.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellations and Refunds:</strong> You may cancel a subscription at any time. If you cancel, you will typically continue to have access to the premium features until the end of your current paid-up subscription period, and your subscription will not renew thereafter:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. We generally do not provide refunds or credits for partial subscription periods or unused services:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}, except where required by law. For example, if you cancel in the middle of a month for a monthly subscription, you will not receive a refund for the remaining days; your benefits will continue until the end of that month. If you believe you deserve a refund due to extenuating circumstances, you can contact us and we may consider requests on a case-by-case basis, but we make no guarantee of refund.</p>
<p><strong>Late Payments:</strong> If we cannot charge your provided payment method (e.g., due to expiration or insufficient funds) and you have not canceled, we may attempt to charge again at a later date. If payment remains unsuccessful, we reserve the right to downgrade or suspend your access to paid features until payment is resolved. It is your responsibility to ensure your billing information is current and accurate.</p>

<h2>5. License and Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms and any applicable laws, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}. This license is provided solely for you to utilize and enjoy the benefits of the Service as intended by us.</p>
<p>All content, software, data, text, graphics, images, logos, and other materials available on or through the Service, including the design, selection, and arrangement thereof, are the intellectual property of Company or its licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You are **not** granted any ownership rights in the Service or any content provided by the Service. You agree not to copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative works from any part of the Service or content without our prior written consent, except as allowed by law or expressly permitted by the Service's functionality:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}.</p>
<p>You further agree that you will not use the Service in a way that is illegal or harmful. In particular, you agree not to:</p>

    <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law or regulation.</li>

    <li>Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the integrity or proper working of the Service. This includes not engaging in activities such as spreading malware, attempting to hack or gain unauthorized access to our systems or other users’ accounts, or imposing an unreasonable load on our infrastructure.</li>

    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of our software, except to the extent such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law.</li>
    <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any security or access controls measures of the Service.</li>
    <li>Resell, rent, or sublicense the Service or any of its content to others without our permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>We reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates this Acceptable Use section, including suspending or terminating the account of such violators and reporting to law enforcement authorities if necessary.</p>

<h2>6. User Content and Data</h2>
<p><strong>User Data:</strong> In the course of using the Service, you may input, upload, or store certain data, including personal health information, dietary logs, and other content (collectively, “<strong>User Content</strong>”). You retain any ownership rights you have in the User Content that you provide. By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, process, host, and display that content as needed to provide the Service and as otherwise permitted by our Privacy Policy. This license allows us, for example, to display your logged meals back to you, to analyze your data in order to provide nutritional insights, and to store your information on our servers. We will only use and share your User Content in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility for User Content:</strong> You are solely responsible for all User Content you submit or generate through the Service. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to provide the content that you provide and that your User Content, and our use of it as allowed by these Terms, will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party. We do not routinely monitor User Content, but we reserve the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any reason, including if we, in our sole discretion, determine that the User Content violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful, objectionable, or infringes someone else’s rights. However, we do not assume any obligation to review User Content.</p>
<p><strong>Backup of Data:</strong> We strive to maintain the security and availability of your data, but we cannot guarantee that there will never be loss of data. You are encouraged to keep a separate backup of any important information you put into the Service. We are not liable for any loss of data that may occur:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}, and you agree that you will not rely on the Service as your sole repository for critical data.</p>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part of it) at any time, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}. We will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>
<p>We may terminate or suspend your account and/or access to the Service immediately, without prior notice, if you breach these Terms or if we determine that your use of the Service poses a risk to us or other users, or creates potential legal exposure for us:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. We may also terminate or suspend your account for inactivity or if we discontinue the Service. Upon any termination of your account, whether by you or us, your right to use the Service will cease immediately. In the event of termination by us, we will have no obligation to refund any fees you have paid, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time by deleting your account through the Service (if such feature is available) or by contacting us with a request to delete your account. Terminating your account will not relieve you of any obligation to pay any accrued fees or charges due to us.</p>
<p>After termination of your account, we may retain your data for a limited period as necessary for legitimate business interests or legal obligations, as outlined in our Privacy Policy, but subject to applicable laws. We have no obligation to retain your User Content or data after termination, and we may delete your data in the normal course of operation. It is your responsibility to export any data you wish to keep prior to closing your account.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that we shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination or suspension of your account, or related deletion of your data:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}. Upon termination, the provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive will remain in effect (such as provisions on ownership, indemnification, disclaimer of warranty, limitation of liability, and governing law).</p>

<h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>The Service and all information, content, and materials made available through it are provided on an “<strong>as is</strong>” and “<strong>as available</strong>” basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Company disclaims all warranties, express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Service and any results obtained from it, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, and reliability. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}. You use the Service at your own risk.</p>
<p>The nutritional information, suggestions, or other content provided by the Service (such as daily calorie targets, macronutrient recommendations, or meal suggestions) are for informational purposes only. **We are not a medical or healthcare provider**, and the Service is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment:contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}. Always seek the advice of a physician or qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or dietary program. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read or accessed through the Service. You are solely responsible for determining whether the recommendations or information provided by the Service are suitable for you, and for your personal health and diet decisions:contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}. Reliance on any information provided by the Service is at your own discretion and risk.</p>
<p>Company does not warrant that any nutritional, weight loss, or health results will be achieved or that the Service will meet your expectations. Any statements about possible health benefits are aspirational and not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of consumers, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. In such cases, the scope and duration of any such warranties will be the minimum permitted under applicable law.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Company or its affiliates, licensors, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, or agents, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your access to or use of (or inability to use) the Service:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}. This limitation applies to all causes of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>To the extent we may be found liable notwithstanding the above limitation, our total cumulative liability to you for any claims arising from or related to the Service or these Terms, regardless of the form of action, will be limited to the greater of: (a) the total amount (if any) you paid to us for the specific Service or feature in the six (6) months immediately before the claim arose, or (b) US $100. The existence of multiple claims or suits under or related to these Terms will not enlarge or extend this limitation of money damages.</p>
<p>We are not liable for any problems or technical malfunctions of any network or lines, servers, providers, software, or equipment, including any injury or damage to any user’s computer or device resulting from use of the Service or download of any materials. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms shall limit or exclude our liability for any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law (for example, liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, or fraud). However, in such cases our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UGA DOOGA LLC, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) that arise out of or relate to: (a) your use or misuse of the Service, (b) your violation of any term of these Terms, (c) your violation of any rights of a third party (including any user content you provide that infringes or misappropriates any third-party rights or violates any law), or (d) your breach of any applicable law or regulation. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), in which case you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. You agree not to settle any such matter without the prior written consent of Company. This indemnification obligation will survive any termination of your account or of the Service.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>We may revise or update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms on our website or within the app and updating the “Last updated” date at the top, or by other appropriate means:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Service.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>These Terms and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Armenia, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You and Company agree that all legal proceedings related to the Service or these Terms (including any arbitration or court proceeding, if applicable) shall be brought exclusively in the competent courts located in Armenia, and you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objection to such venue on the grounds of jurisdiction or forum non conveniens, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>If you are a consumer residing in a jurisdiction that provides you with certain mandatory rights or remedies, nothing in this Governing Law section will limit those rights to the extent they cannot be limited by contract.</p>
<p><strong>No Class Actions:</strong> You and Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. (This provision may not apply in certain jurisdictions that disallow class action waivers, in which case it is severable to the minimum extent necessary.)</p>
<p><strong>Injunctive Relief:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, you agree that a breach of these Terms may cause irreparable harm to Company for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and Company may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or stop such breach without having to prove damages or post a bond.</p>

<h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms (along with the Privacy Policy and any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the Service) constitute the entire agreement between you and Company regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements or understandings (whether oral or written) relating to the same subject matter:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}. In case of any conflict between these Terms and any other terms posted for a specific feature of the Service, the latter terms shall control for that feature or service.</p>
<p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or any of your rights or obligations hereunder) without our prior written consent. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms and our obligations without restriction as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p>
<p><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. The exercise of one remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of any other remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The Service may contain links or integrations to third-party websites or services that we do not own or control. For example, we may link to nutritional information sources or allow you to export data to other apps. We are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and you acknowledge that your use of them will be governed by those third parties’ terms and privacy policies, not ours:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}. We do not endorse any third-party service and you use them at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Company will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform as required by these Terms because of any cause or condition beyond Company’s reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor conditions, power failures, internet or telecommunications failures, or acts of government.</p>
